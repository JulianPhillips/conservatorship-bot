However, only a judge can decide if it's a \"strong case\" for a conservatorship.\n\nHere’s what works in your favor, based on your intake and plan:\n\n*   **Specific, Documented Risks:** You have concrete examples of danger (kitchen fires, self-neglect) and medical non-compliance. These are the types of \"substantial harm\" the court looks for.\n*   **Tried Less Restrictive Options:** You have a Power of Attorney (POA), which the court will ask about. Your plan explains that the POA hasn't been enough to stop the safety crises, which is a key point.\n*   **Attempted to Get Medical Evidence:** You took Betty to the hospital and asked for an affidavit. Their refusal is itself important documentation, as noted in the `documentation_and_recording` section of your plan.\n\n**Key Challenges (from your plan):**\n\n1.  **Missing Medical Statement:** The hospital's refusal to provide an affidavit is a major hurdle. The `filing_requirements` in your plan state a medical statement is \"usually required.\" You'll need to get this from another doctor or ask the court to order an evaluation.\n2.  **The \"Least Restrictive\" Test:** The judge must find that conservatorship is the *least restrictive* way to keep Betty safe. You'll need to be ready to explain why the existing POA, family help, and other supports aren't sufficient *now*.\n\n**What to Do Next (from your `todo` list):**\n\n1.  **Contact a Lawyer:** This is the most critical step. Call **Memphis Area Legal Services ((901) 523‑8822)** to discuss your documented concerns and the hospital's refusal. A lawyer can advise on how strong your evidence is and the best way to present it.\n2.  **Formally Request Medical Documentation:** Follow the plan's advice to ask Betty's treating physician (or the hospital) in writing for a **functional capacity evaluation** or any note about her decision-making ability.\n3.  **Organize Your Evidence:** Gather everything from the `checklist_items`—your notes on the fires, medication issues, and the hospital refusal. This documented timeline will be crucial.\n\n**Remember:** You are not asking if you're \"right\" to be concerned—you clearly are. You're asking if a judge will agree that a court order is the necessary and least restrictive solution. A Tennessee attorney is the only one who can review your full evidence and give you a professional opinion on your case's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Always remind yourself:** This information is to help you organize and talk to a lawyer. Only a Tennessee judge can decide if a conservatorship is needed."}]}
