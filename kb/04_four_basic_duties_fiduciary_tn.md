# Four basic duties when you manage someone’s money

When the court makes you conservator of someone’s money and property, you are a **fiduciary**.  
That means the law expects you to be careful, honest, and to follow the rules.

You have four main duties:

1. Act only in the conservatee’s best interest.  
2. Manage the conservatee’s money and property carefully.  
3. Keep the conservatee’s money and property separate from your own.  
4. Keep good records and report to the court.

## Duty 1: Act only in the conservatee’s best interest

You must make choices that are good for the conservatee, not for you or anyone else.

### Know what the court allows you to do

- Read the court order.  
  - It tells you exactly what powers you have and what duties you have.  
  - Some orders are detailed, some are short.  
- If you do not understand something, ask a lawyer or the court for help.  
- Do not do things the order does not allow.  
- If you want to sell a house or land, or do something big, you will usually need court permission first.

### Involve the conservatee as much as you can

When you decide things for the conservatee:

1. First, think about what is safest and best for them.  
   - Make sure basic needs are met: housing, food, health, safety.  
   - Do not worry first about saving money for people who might inherit later.

2. Second, ask the conservatee what they want, if they can tell you.  
   - They might be able to make some decisions.  
   - If what they want is similar to what they have wanted in the past and does not put them in serious danger, try to respect it.

3. Third, if the conservatee cannot explain what they want:  
   - Look at how they decided things in the past.  
   - Talk to people who know them well.  
   - Try to choose what they would likely choose if they could.

This is called **acting in their best interest** and using **substituted judgment**.

### Talk clearly with the conservatee and helpers

- The conservatee may communicate in different ways: talking, writing, sign language, pictures, or devices.  
- They may have helpers like support coordinators, case managers, or direct support staff.  
- Ask them for information; they may know the person’s habits and wishes.

### Avoid conflicts of interest

You must not use the conservatee’s money for your gain or someone else’s gain.

- Do not borrow the conservatee’s money.  
- Do not give loans or gifts from their money without court approval.  
- Do not change plans for who gets their money after they die unless a lawyer and the court say it is clearly in their best interest.  
- Do not pay yourself from the conservatee’s money unless the court says you can, and then:  
  - Charge only reasonable fees.  
  - Keep careful records of your time and tasks.  
  - Do not charge for normal family help like visiting or doing small chores.

**Examples of possible conflicts:**

- You buy a car with the conservatee’s money but mainly use it for yourself.  
- You hire your own child to do repair work and pay them from the conservatee’s money.

These situations can look like you are helping yourself instead of the conservatee and can get you in trouble.

## Duty 2: Manage the conservatee’s money and property carefully

You must treat the conservatee’s money more carefully than your own.

### Make an inventory

Quickly make a list of everything the conservatee owns and everything they owe.

Include:

- Bank accounts and cash.  
- Income (pay, benefits, pensions, rental income).  
- House, land, and cars.  
- Insurance policies.  
- Stocks, bonds, or retirement accounts.  
- Trusts where the conservatee is a beneficiary.  
- Jewelry, furniture, and other valuable items.  
- Credit card debt and other loans.

File this inventory with the court by the deadline and keep a copy.  
Ask the court for the right form and due date.

### Bond or restricted account

- The court may require a **bond**, which is an insurance policy to protect the conservatee’s money if you fail in your duties.  
- Sometimes, instead of a bond, the court will “freeze” some funds in a restricted account you cannot touch without permission.

Follow the court’s instructions on bonds and restricted accounts.

### Protect the conservatee’s property

- Use direct deposit for income and have bills sent to you.  
- Keep money in safe bank accounts with low fees.  
- Store valuables safely; sometimes it is better to sell items than pay high storage fees.  
- Review bank statements and other papers regularly.

### Make a property management plan (budget)

Often you must file a **property management plan**.

- List expected monthly costs: housing, food, care, medicine, transportation, clothes, etc.  
- Include a reasonable amount of spending money for the conservatee, if appropriate.  
- Think about big one‑time costs (dental work, equipment, repairs).  
- Stick to the plan; ask the court before making big changes or big purchases.  
- If you invest money, get professional advice and choose safe, sensible investments based on the conservatee’s needs.

### Pay bills, handle property, and look for benefits

- Pay the conservatee’s bills and taxes on time.  
- Maintain and insure any house or car.  
- Collect money others owe the conservatee.  
- Decide if it is safe and good for the conservatee to stay at home; if not, look at other housing options and keep them close to people and places that matter to them.  
- Check what benefits they can get (Social Security, SSI, TennCare/Medicaid, SNAP, housing help, veterans benefits, etc.) and help them apply.

Be very careful with any decision that might affect TennCare/Medicaid; talk to a lawyer if you are unsure.

## Duty 3: Keep the conservatee’s money and property separate

Never mix the conservatee’s money with your money or anyone else’s.

- Do not put the conservatee’s money into your personal bank account.  
- Avoid joint accounts; if one already exists, get legal advice about how to change it.  
- Keep accounts in the conservatee’s name, with you listed as conservator.  
- Open special conservatorship or fiduciary accounts if the bank offers them.

When you sign for money matters, sign like this:

> Your Name, conservator for [Conservatee Name]

Do not sign just the conservatee’s name.

Always pay the conservatee’s expenses from their funds, not yours.  
If you must use your own money in an emergency, keep receipts and write down exactly what you spent and when you paid yourself back.

## Duty 4: Keep good records and report to the court

You must be able to show the court **every** dollar that came in and every dollar that went out.

### Daily record‑keeping

- Keep a written log or spreadsheet of:  
  - Money received (amount, date, where it came from).  
  - Money spent (amount, date, who was paid, and why).  
- Keep receipts and notes for all spending, even small amounts.  
- Try not to use cash.  
  - If you must use cash, keep receipts or write down details right away.

### Getting paid as conservator

If the court allows you to charge a fee:

- Make sure the fee is reasonable.  
- Track your time, tasks, and dates in detail.  
- Only charge for work that is truly part of your conservator duties, not normal family help.

### Court accountings

You must file accountings when the court says:

- Use the forms or format the court gives you.  
- File on time (for example: first “interim” accounting at six months, then yearly).  
- Your accounting must “add up”:  
  - Beginning balance  
  - Plus income  
  - Minus expenses  
  - Equals ending balance  
  - The ending balance for one year becomes the beginning balance for the next.

If you do not understand the form, ask court staff, a lawyer, a bookkeeper, or an accountant for help.

### Final accounting when the conservatorship ends

When the conservatorship ends (for example, if the conservatee dies or the court ends your appointment):

- Tell the court.  
- Prepare a final accounting of all money and property.  
- Ask the court to release you from your duties after everything is handed over to the right person (like an executor, administrator, or new conservator).  
- You may need to pay final bills (such as funeral or last medical bills) from the conservatee’s funds before turning the rest over.

Until the court says you are done, you are still responsible for keeping the money and property safe and handled correctly.
