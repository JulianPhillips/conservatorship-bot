# Working with other decision‑makers

You may not be the only person helping manage the conservatee’s life and money.  
The court and different agencies can give power to different people.

## Co‑conservators

Sometimes the court picks more than one conservator.

- There may be **co‑conservators of the property** (two people share money duties).  
- There may be a **conservator of the person** (health and personal life) and a **conservator of the property** (money and property).

If you share the role:

- You are partners in making decisions.  
- You must talk to each other and plan together.  
- For big decisions like moving the conservatee or changing their care, you must agree and coordinate money and care decisions.

## Other types of fiduciaries

The conservatee may already have other people with legal power, for example:

- An **agent under a power of attorney**, who can act for them in certain areas.  
- A **representative payee**, who manages Social Security checks.  
- A **VA fiduciary**, who manages veterans’ benefits.  
- A **trustee**, who manages money in a trust for the conservatee.

These people also have duties to act in the conservatee’s best interest.

You should:

- Learn who they are.  
- Share important information with them.  
- Make sure you are not working against each other.

## Working with professionals

You will often need help from professionals, such as:

- Lawyers.  
- Financial advisors, brokers, or accountants.  
- Bookkeepers.  
- Real estate agents and appraisers.  
- Doctors, nurses, therapists, or care managers.  
- Social workers or case managers.

You can usually pay these people with the conservatee’s money, but:

- Get **court approval** before signing contracts, if the court requires it.  
- Check that each professional is properly licensed and in good standing.  
- Ask about their experience and any complaints against them.  
- Get a clear plan and fee estimate in writing.  
- Read contracts carefully before you sign.  
- Use their advice, but remember: **you** are the decision‑maker for the conservatee, not them.

## Government benefits need special appointments

Being conservator of the property does **not** automatically give you control over:

- Social Security benefits.  
- Veterans (VA) benefits.  
- Some other federal payments.

To manage those, you may need to be:

- Named as **representative payee** by Social Security.  
- Named as a **VA fiduciary** by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Contact those agencies directly to find out what is required.

## Handling disagreements with family and friends

Sometimes family or friends will disagree with your choices about the conservatee’s money or care.

To reduce problems:

- Follow your four basic duties: best interest, careful management, separate money, and good records.  
- Be as open as you reasonably can about what you are doing and why.  
- Keep written records that show you are acting for the conservatee, not yourself.

If conflict grows:

- Consider using a **mediator** or family counselor to help everyone talk.  
- Ask the court or a lawyer what to do if someone is blocking needed decisions or accusing you unfairly.

Remember: your job is to protect the conservatee and follow the court’s orders, even when that is uncomfortable for other people.
