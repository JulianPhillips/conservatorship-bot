# How to protect yourself and build a paper trail (Tennessee)

This section is about how families can protect themselves, especially Black families, when systems are not doing right by them.  
It is information, not legal advice.

## Recording conversations in Tennessee

Tennessee is a **one‑party consent** state for recording most phone and in‑person conversations.

That means:

- If **you** are part of the conversation, **you** can choose to record it without telling the other person.  
- You **cannot** legally record a conversation you are not part of (no secret “wiretapping” of other people). 
- Do not use recordings for illegal purposes (like blackmail or threats).

Good practices:

- Whenever possible, you can record calls and in‑person talks with doctors, social workers, hospital staff, or others **when you are in the conversation**.  
- Save the recordings in a safe place and label them with date, time, and who was speaking.  
- If any call involves people in other states, it can be safer to say: “I’m recording this so I don’t miss anything. Is that okay?” because some states have stricter consent rules.

If you have questions about recording law, talk to a Tennessee lawyer.

## How to document every interaction

When a hospital, nursing home, or other system is not treating your family right, your **documentation** is power.

For every important interaction:

- Write down **who** you spoke with (name, role, and hospital or office).  
- Write down **when** (date and time).  
- Write down **where** (phone, in person, which unit or office).  
- Write down **what was said**:  
  - What you asked for.  
  - What they said.  
  - Any promises, refusals, or threats.  
- If you record the call or meeting (and you are allowed to), note “recorded” in your notes.

Simple structure you can reuse:

- Date / time:  
- Place / phone:  
- Who was there:  
- What we asked:  
- What they said / did:  
- How it affected us:  

Keep:

- A notebook, Google Doc, or spreadsheet for these notes.  
- Screenshots of messages or patient portal notes.  
- Copies of letters, bills, or forms.

This kind of record makes it much easier for a lawyer or advocate to understand what happened and help you.

## Asking for a functional capacity evaluation

In Tennessee conservatorship cases, judges care about **functional capacity** – what the person can and cannot do in daily life and decision‑making.

When dealing with hospitals or doctors, questions you can ask include:

- “Can you please document an evaluation of [my loved one]’s **functional capacity**?”  
- “Can you explain what activities they can still do on their own, and where they truly need help?”  
- “Can you put in the record whether there are **less restrictive** options than conservatorship, like power of attorney or supported decision‑making?”

When you ask:

- Note the **date, doctor’s name, and exact request** in your documentation file.  
- Ask for copies of any evaluation or note they put in the chart, and keep those with your records.

These questions help show whether the push for conservatorship is really about safety, or about convenience or business reasons.

## Organizing information for a lawyer

To make it easy for a lawyer to help you, try to keep these things together:

1. **Timeline**  
   - A simple list of key dates: hospital admissions, big meetings, calls where important decisions were made, court dates.

2. **Call and meeting log**  
   - One page (or spreadsheet) where each row is one interaction: date, who, what it was about, what was decided.

3. **Medical and legal papers**  
   - Copies of hospital records, capacity evaluations, conservatorship petitions, court orders, and notices.  
   - Any letters from the hospital, nursing home, or insurance.

4. **Red flags and concerns**  
   - Notes on anything that feels racist, disrespectful, or like they are trying to push the family out of decisions.  
   - Times when staff refused to answer questions, give records, or let you be with your loved one.

When you meet a lawyer or legal aid:

- Bring this packet (or share it online).  
- Be honest about what happened and what you want to protect (health, money, house, land, etc.).

## Naming the systemic injustice

Many Black families experience:

- Being ignored or talked over in medical settings.  
- Hospitals making decisions without real consent.  
- Pressure to accept conservatorships or placements that feel more about money than care.

This guide is here to help you:

- Ask clear, strong questions.  
- Build a record of what systems did and didn’t do.  
- Show judges and lawyers, in writing and on tape, **how you tried to protect your loved one**.

You still need a lawyer for legal strategy, but your notes, recordings, and organized documents give that lawyer something strong to work with.
