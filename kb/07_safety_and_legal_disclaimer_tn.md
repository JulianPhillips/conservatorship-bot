# Important safety and legal disclaimer

This tool is here to help you understand the conservatorship process in simple language and get organized.  
It is **not** a lawyer, a law firm, or a court.

---

## This is not legal advice

- The information you see here is **general education**, not legal advice for your specific case.  
- Laws and court rules can change, and different judges may do things differently.  
- What was true for one family may not be true for you.  
- You should always talk to a licensed Tennessee attorney about your own situation before filing papers or making big decisions.

---

## This tool does not create an attorney‑client relationship

- Using this tool does **not** make the tool, its creators, or its operators your lawyer.  
- Nothing you type here is confidential legal advice.  
- The tool cannot represent you in court, talk to the judge for you, or speak to the hospital or any agency on your behalf.

---

## The tool may be wrong, incomplete, or out of date

- The tool tries to stay grounded in Tennessee law and Memphis / Shelby County practice, but it can make mistakes.  
- It may:
  - Miss local rule changes or new fees.  
  - Simplify things that are actually more complex in real life.  
  - Use language that does not match the exact wording of forms or statutes.  
- You should always double‑check:
  - Court addresses, hours, and filing fees.  
  - Current forms and deadlines.  
  - Any legal conclusions, with a Tennessee lawyer or the court clerk.

---

## The tool does not decide if you need a conservatorship

- Only a **judge** can decide:
  - Whether someone lacks capacity.  
  - Whether a conservatorship is needed.  
  - Who should serve as conservator.  
  - Which rights are removed and which rights stay with the person.

- This tool:
  - Cannot “approve” or “deny” a conservatorship.  
  - Cannot tell you what the judge will decide.  
  - Can only help you understand the process and prepare questions and checklists.

---

## The tool does not replace doctors or mental health professionals

- Medical and mental health decisions must be made with licensed professionals.  
- This tool:
  - Cannot diagnose any condition.  
  - Cannot say whether someone is “disabled” or has “capacity” under Tennessee law.  
  - Cannot tell doctors what to write in their evaluations.

- It can help you:
  - Understand what “functional capacity” means in plain language.  
  - Prepare questions to ask doctors and hospitals.  
  - Organize records and notes for your attorney.

---

## Recording and documentation: know the limits

- Tennessee is generally a **one‑party consent** state for recording conversations, meaning if you are part of the conversation, you can usually record it without telling the other person.
- Other states may have stricter rules, especially for phone calls or hidden cameras.  
- This tool cannot:
  - Guarantee that any particular recording is legal in all situations.  
  - Tell you how a judge or agency will treat your recordings or notes.

If you are unsure, talk to a Tennessee lawyer before recording or sharing recordings.

---

## Systemic bias and harm

- Many Black families and other marginalized communities face bias and mistreatment in hospitals, courts, and agencies.  
- This tool:
  - Tries to name that reality and help you build a record of what happened.  
  - Cannot stop racism, discrimination, or abuse by itself.  
  - Cannot guarantee a fair outcome in any specific case.

You may still need support from legal aid, community organizations, or civil rights advocates.

---

## Emergencies and safety

- This tool is **not** for emergencies.  
- If someone is in immediate danger:
  - Call 911 or your local emergency number.  
  - Call Adult Protective Services if there is abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an older adult or adult with a disability.  
  - Call crisis hotlines or medical providers for urgent health concerns.

The tool cannot contact emergency services for you.

---

## How to use this tool safely

- Use this tool as:
  - A way to learn basic concepts.  
  - A way to build checklists and organize documents.  
  - A starting point for better conversations with your lawyer, the court clerk, and medical providers.

- Do **not**:
  - File court papers based only on this tool without checking with a lawyer or the court.  
  - Ignore advice from your attorney because of something the tool said.  
  - Treat the tool’s outputs as official court forms unless a lawyer has reviewed them.
