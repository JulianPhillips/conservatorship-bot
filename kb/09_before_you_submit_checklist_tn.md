# “Before you hit submit” checklist

Use this list before you file papers, send forms to the court, or act on a plan from this tool.  
It helps you slow down and double‑check key points.

---

## 1. Have you talked to a Tennessee lawyer?

- If possible, show a Tennessee attorney:
  - Your draft petition or forms.  
  - The checklists and plan this tool created.  
  - Your notes and documentation.

- Ask:
  - “Does this match Tennessee law and Shelby County practice right now?”  
  - “Do you see any risks for our loved one, our family, or our property?”

If you cannot afford a lawyer, contact legal aid to see if you qualify for free help.

## 2. Are you clear on **why** you are filing?

Take a moment to write, in one or two sentences:

- What are you trying to protect? (for example: your loved one’s safety, house, Social Security, medical care)  
- Why is conservatorship needed now, instead of less‑restrictive options?

If you cannot answer this clearly, you may need more time or advice before filing.

---

## 3. Did you try less‑restrictive options?

Before asking the court to take away rights, ask yourself:

- Have you looked at:
  - Powers of attorney (money or health).  
  - Supported decision‑making.  
  - Joint accounts or representative payee for benefits.  
  - Extra support and supervision without court orders?

- Can you explain to a judge:
  - What you tried.  
  - Why it did or did not work.

Make a short note of this to keep with your papers.

## 4. Is your information complete and consistent?

Check your draft against this quick list:

- Person’s full legal name, birthdate, and Memphis / Shelby County address are correct.  
- Your name, address, and relationship are correct.  
- Close family members are listed with correct names and contact information.  
- You described:
  - The person’s health and thinking problems in simple, honest language.  
  - Real‑world examples of how they struggle and where they still do fine.  
- The rights you are asking the court to move are:
  - Specific (for example: money, medical decisions, contracts)  
  - No broader than truly needed.

If something feels off, fix it now or ask a lawyer before you file.

## 5. Do your documents line up?

Gather these in one place:

- Medical or psychological statements about capacity, if you have them.  
- Any functional capacity evaluations or doctor notes about what the person can and cannot do.  
- Proof of your loved one’s income and property (for the inventory and management plan).  
- Any powers of attorney, living wills, or other papers already in place.

Ask:

- “Does what I am asking for in court match what these documents say?”  
- If not, talk to a lawyer about how to explain the differences.

---

## 6. Are you ready for the responsibilities?

Before you ask to be conservator, check yourself:

- Do you understand the **four basic duties**:
  - Act only in the person’s best interest.  
  - Manage their money and property carefully.  
  - Keep their money separate from yours.  
  - Keep good records and report to the court.

- Are you ready to:
  - File an inventory on time.  
  - File yearly accountings if you handle money.  
  - Keep notes of major decisions and why you made them.  
  - Work with other family and helpers, even when it is hard.

If you are not sure you can do this, talk to your lawyer about other options (co‑conservator, public guardian, or another trusted person).

---

## 7. Have you reviewed the safety and legal disclaimer?

Before you act on anything from this tool:

- Read the **Safety and Legal Disclaimer** section.  
- Remember:
  - This tool is not a lawyer or the court.  
  - It can be wrong or out of date.  
  - It is a starting point, not the final word.

---

## 8. Have you saved and backed up your work?

Make sure you:

- Save copies of:
  - Your answers in this tool.  
  - Any checklists, drafts, or plans it produced.  
  - Your documentation log and recordings (if any).

- Store them:
  - In a safe digital folder, and  
  - On paper in a folder you can bring to court or to your lawyer.

Label everything with dates so you can find it quickly.

---

## 9. One last pause

Before you hit “submit,” “file,” or “download for court”:

- Take a breath.  
- Ask yourself:
  - “Is this really in my loved one’s best interest?”  
  - “Am I prepared for what comes after this?”

If the answer feels unsure, it is okay to wait, ask more questions, or get more help before moving forward.
