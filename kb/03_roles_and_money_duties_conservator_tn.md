# Conservator of the property

A conservator of the property is a person the court picks to handle someone else’s money and property.  
This might include income, bank accounts, a house, land, or a car.

The court does this when it decides the person cannot safely manage money and property alone because of a disability or health problem.

# Conservator of the person

A conservator of the person is a person the court picks to help with personal life decisions.

This can include:

- Medical care and treatment choices.  
- Where the person lives.  
- Day‑to‑day needs and care.  
- Work or day programs.

One person can be both conservator of the person and conservator of the property.  
Sometimes the court chooses two different people to share the roles.

# Person with a disability

The person with a disability is the adult the court is trying to protect.

You may also hear:

- “Respondent.”  
- “Incapacitated person.”  
- “Ward.”

This is the person the judge has decided cannot manage some personal or money decisions alone.

# Conflict of interest

A conflict of interest happens when:

- A choice would be good for the conservator or someone else,  
- But not good for the person with a disability.

A conservator of the property must avoid this.  
They must make choices that are best for the person with a disability, even if it is not best for themselves or their family.

# Conservatorship order

A conservatorship order is the judge’s written decision.

It:

- Says that a conservatorship exists.  
- Names the conservator.  
- Lists what the conservator can and cannot do.

This order is separate from the “letters of conservatorship.”

# Surety bond

A bond is like an insurance policy.

The court often makes a conservator of the property get a bond before they can handle money and property.  
If the conservator steals or misuses money, the bond can help pay it back.

Sometimes the judge can decide to waive (skip) the bond.

---

# Letters of conservatorship

Letters of conservatorship are papers from the court clerk that prove the conservator has legal power.

Banks and other places may ask to see these letters before they let the conservator move or manage money.  
These letters are different from the conservatorship order.

# Certificate of service

A certificate of service is a list of people who must get copies of certain court papers.  
These people are called “interested parties.”

They can include:

- The person with a disability.  
- Close family members.  
- Others the court wants to keep informed.

When the conservator files reports, they may have to show the court who received copies.

# Annual accounting

An annual accounting is a yearly money report.

The conservator of the property must:

- List all the money that came in during the year.  
- List all the money that was spent.  
- Show bank statements and records to back it up.  
- File this report with the court.

This lets the court check that the money is being used correctly.

---

# Property management plan

A property management plan is a budget and plan for how to use and protect the person’s money and property.

The conservator of the property prepares this plan and gives it to the court.  
The court reviews and may approve it or ask for changes.

# What is a fiduciary?

When you manage someone else’s money or property, you are a **fiduciary**.

The law says you must:

1. Act only in the other person’s best interest.  
2. Manage their money and property carefully.  
3. Keep their money and property separate from your own.  
4. Keep good, clear records.

It does not matter if you are family or not.  
If you break these rules, the court can:

- Remove you as conservator.  
- Make you pay money back.  
- In serious cases, you could be sued or even charged with a crime.

Remember: It is **not** your money.

# Other types of fiduciaries you might see

You may work with other people who also manage money for your loved one, such as:

- **Trustees** of a trust, who manage money and property put into a trust.  
- **Representative payees** or VA fiduciaries, who manage government benefit checks.  
- **Agents under a power of attorney**, who have legal papers giving them power to act.

They also have duties to act in the best interest of the person whose money they manage.

# Questions and answers: conservator of the property

### What is a conservator of the property?

It is someone the court picks to handle money and property for a person who cannot manage it alone.

Sometimes:

- The same person is also conservator of the person (for health and personal decisions).  
- A different person is conservator of the person.  
- The person with a disability still makes some or all personal decisions alone.

In Tennessee:

- The money and property together are called the person’s **estate**.  
- The person under conservatorship may be called an incapacitated person, a person with a disability, or the respondent.

### What are your duties to the person?

You must:

- Always act in their best interest.  
- Use their money for their needs, not yours.  
- Talk with them and include them in decisions as much as possible.

### What are your duties to the court?

You are an agent of the court.  
The court trusted you with this job.

You must:

- Follow the court’s orders.  
- File reports, accountings, and plans when the court says.  
- Answer questions if the judge or clerk asks about the money or property.

### When do your duties end?

Your duties as conservator of the property end when the court says so.

This can happen when:

- The court appoints someone else.

- The court decides the person no longer needs a conservator.

Until then, you are responsible for managing the money and property under the court’s watch.
