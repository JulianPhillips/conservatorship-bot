# Watching for money abuse and scams

As conservator over money and property, part of your job is to protect your loved one from people who might steal from them or trick them.

Money abuse can come from:

- Family.  
- Friends and neighbors.  
- Caregivers and helpers.  
- Strangers and scammers.  
- Even people who say they are “professionals.”

## Signs of financial exploitation

Watch for these warning signs:

- Money or property is missing, and no one can explain why.  
- Your loved one says money or things are missing.  
- Sudden changes in spending or saving:  
  - Large cash withdrawals.  
  - Attempts to wire a lot of money.  
  - New or unusual gifts to family, caregivers, or a “new best friend.”  
  - Lots of ATM withdrawals.  
  - Bills are not getting paid, even though money should be there.  
  - Bank statements and bills stop coming or are being sent somewhere else.  
  - New names added to bank accounts your loved one cannot explain.  
  - Purchases that do not make sense.  
  - New “beneficiary” changes on life insurance, retirement, or a will.  
  - A caregiver or relative suddenly “takes over” the money.

- Your loved one seems scared of a caregiver, friend, or family member.  
- Someone keeps your loved one away from visitors or phone calls or will not let them speak alone.

Even if your loved one does not control much money, people can still exploit them.
