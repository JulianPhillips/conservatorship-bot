## When the hospital refuses to give needed paperwork

Sometimes hospitals or doctors will not give the exact papers you ask for, like a signed affidavit or statement needed for a Tennessee conservatorship case.

If this happens:

- Write down:
  - The date and time you asked.  
  - The name and role of the person you asked.  
  - Exactly what you requested (for example: “a signed doctor statement / affidavit for the conservatorship case”).  
  - Exactly what they said in response (for example: “we do not do that,” “we will only give a short note,” or “talk to legal”).  

- Ask what they **will** provide:
  - “Can you give us any written statement that explains diagnosis, functional limits, and whether the person can make decisions safely?”  
  - “Can you put your reasons for refusing this specific form in the chart or in a letter?”

- Ask for copies of:
  - Any note they put in the chart about capacity or decision‑making.  
  - Any letter or message where they refuse to sign the form.

- Save all of this in your documentation file so a lawyer can:
  - Decide if the court can order an exam or statement instead.  
  - Show the judge that the family tried to get the right paperwork and the hospital would not cooperate.

The exact form number or rule (for example, a specific Tennessee Code or court rule section) is something your lawyer can match up.  
Your job is to **document that you asked** and **how the hospital responded**, so the court can see the full picture.
