# Checklist before you ask for a conservatorship

Before you go to court, it helps to slow down and ask some hard questions.  
Conservatorship is serious. It takes away some rights. It should not be the first step.

Use these questions as a checklist:

- What is really happening that made you think about conservatorship?  
  - Example: bills are not paid, scams, unsafe people in the house, missed medicine.

- Have you tried other options that are less restrictive?  
  - Power of attorney, joint accounts, supported decision‑making, extra support.

- Does your loved one understand the basics of money?  
  - Do they know that things cost money?  
  - Do they know they can run out of money?

- Do they understand basic safety?  
  - Can they tell when a situation or person is unsafe?  
  - Do they leave doors open, wander, or let strangers in?

- Can they give informed consent? That means:  
  - Do they know what choices they have?  
  - Do they understand the risks and benefits of each choice?  
  - Would a reasonable person make the same choice in that situation?

- Are doctors or hospitals asking for “proof” that someone has legal power to decide?  
  - Are they refusing to follow your loved one’s wishes without papers?

- Is the home or living situation clearly unsafe?  
  - Are there hazards, no food, no working utilities, or dangerous people around?

- Do they make choices that cause **serious** harm to themselves or others?  
  - This is more than just “we disagree” or “they don’t take my advice.”  
  - It means real risk of injury, losing the home, losing benefits, or being abused.

- Are they easy to exploit?  
  - Have they been tricked into signing papers?  
  - Have people taken money, cards, or possessions from them?

If many of these questions worry you and other supports are not enough, conservatorship might be needed.  
If only a few are true and you can help in other ways, a limited conservatorship or another tool might be better.

# In what areas does the person need help?

You do not have to ask the court to take control of everything.  
Think about where the person truly cannot manage alone.

Common areas to review:

- **Living arrangements**  
  - Can they choose and keep a safe place to live?

- **Personal safety**  
  - Can they stay safe at home and in the community?

- **Finances and property**  
  - Can they manage bills, rent, and bank accounts without being cheated?

- **Health care**  
  - Can they understand treatment options and make choices about care?

- **Education or services**  
  - Can they understand and make decisions about school, programs, or services?

From this, you can ask the court for:

- A limited conservatorship, where only some rights are moved to the conservator.  
- A more complete conservatorship, only if the person cannot handle most decisions at all.

Always ask yourself:

- What rights can this person safely **keep**?
- What rights truly need to be moved to someone else?

# Main steps to set up a conservatorship in Tennessee

Every county and judge may do things a little differently, but these are the common steps:

1. **File a petition**  
   - You file papers in the court that has power over the case (for Memphis, this is usually Shelby County Probate Court).  
   - The papers explain why you think a conservatorship is needed and what powers you are asking for.

2. **Guardian ad litem (GAL) may be appointed**  
   - The court may pick a lawyer called a guardian ad litem.  
   - The GAL’s job is to look at the facts and help protect the person’s rights.

3. **The person can contest the petition**  
   - The person you want to protect has the right to say “I do not agree” and to tell their side.

4. **Doctor or psychologist statement**  
   - A medical professional usually must write a report describing the person’s condition and ability to make decisions.

5. **GAL investigation and report**  
   - The guardian ad litem may:  
     - Talk to the person and the proposed conservator.  
     - Talk to family or other witnesses.  
     - Read medical and money records.  
   - The GAL then writes a report and recommendation for the judge.

6. **Judge may ask for more evidence**  
   - The judge can ask for more records, witnesses, or other proof if needed.

7. **Hearing is scheduled and notice is given**  
   - A court date is set so everyone can be heard.  
   - The court uses a **Notice of Hearing** form to let the person with a disability and other interested people know the date, time, and place of the hearing.

8. **Court hearing**  
   - The judge hears evidence and decides:  
     - Does the person lack capacity in some areas?  
     - Is conservatorship necessary?  
     - If needed, in which specific areas?

9. **Court takes limited responsibility**  
   - In the areas where the judge finds a real need, the court becomes responsible for making sure the person is protected.

10. **Conservator is appointed**  
    - The judge picks a conservator (or co‑conservators) to act as the court’s helper.

11. **File an inventory of money and property**  
    - The conservator usually must fill out an **Inventory** form that lists all of the person’s money and property (sometimes called their “estate”).  
    - The court sets a deadline for this inventory. It helps the judge see what needs to be protected.

12. **Order of conservatorship is issued**  
    - The court signs an order that says:  
      - What areas the conservator controls.  
      - What rights the person keeps.

13. **Rights that are not removed stay with the person**  
    - The person keeps all rights that the court does not clearly move to the conservator.

14. **Conservator reports to the court**  
    - The conservator must follow the court’s rules and send reports as required.  
    - This may include yearly reports on money and on how the person is doing.

15. **Court can change conservators**  
    - If the conservator is not doing the job, the judge can replace them with someone else.

16. **Moving to another county**  
    - If the person with a conservator moves to a new county, the case usually must be moved to that county’s court.

17. **Changing or ending the conservatorship**  
    - The person, or someone speaking for them, can ask the court to change or end the conservatorship if things change.  
    - The judge then looks at new facts and decides whether to keep, change, or remove it.
