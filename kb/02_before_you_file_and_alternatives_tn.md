# Adults and conservatorship in Tennessee

In Tennessee, every adult is assumed to be able to make their own choices.  
That includes adults with disabilities.

A conservatorship is when a court says one adult cannot handle some decisions alone and gives another adult the power to help make those decisions.  
The person who needs help keeps all their rights **except** the ones the court clearly moves to the conservator.

The court looks at:

- Can this person understand choices and consequences in certain parts of life?
- Are they putting themselves or their money in real danger?
- Are there safer, smaller steps we can try before taking away rights?

The court uses reports from doctors, psychologists, and other people who know the situation.  
Only the judge can decide if someone needs a conservator.

# When should you think about conservatorship?

Bad choices alone are not enough.  
Every adult can make some “bad” decisions, like eating junk food or spending too much money sometimes.

You start to think about conservatorship when:

- The person often makes serious choices that hurt them.
- They do not understand what could happen because of those choices.
- They cannot keep themselves safe with money, housing, or health.
- They cannot understand important papers even when someone explains.

You can have a family talk to look at how the person handles different areas, such as:

- Getting medical help when they are sick or hurt.
- Understanding treatment that may be painful or hard.
- Making and keeping medical appointments.
- Managing money: paying bills, handling a paycheck or benefits check.
- Understanding what it means to sign a contract or lease.
- Using a bank account or card without being taken advantage of.
- Staying safe at home and in the community.
- Understanding letters and notices from doctors, landlords, or agencies.

If the person can do most of these things with **some help**, you may not need full conservatorship.

# Other options before conservatorship

Conservatorship is a big step.  
It takes away some rights and puts the court in charge.  
Before you file, you should look at other ways to help.

Some options include:

- **Joint or limited bank accounts**  
  - You can set up an account where a trusted person helps watch spending.  
  - A representative payee can help manage Social Security checks.

- **Power of attorney (POA)**  
  - The person signs papers while they still understand, giving someone they trust power to help with money or health decisions.  
  - This can avoid a court case if it is used correctly.

- **Supported decision‑making**  
  - The person stays in charge but asks trusted people to explain choices, risks, and options in a way they understand.  
  - This might include using stories, videos, or simple language to explain hard decisions.

- **Extra support and information**  
  - Sometimes the person just needs things explained differently or more than once.  
  - A friend, family member, or helper can talk through big choices without taking rights away.

These tools can sometimes give enough protection without a judge getting involved.  
If one of these options works, you might not need to file for conservatorship.

# Limited vs full conservatorship

If you do file, the court should remove **only** the rights the person truly cannot use safely.

- **Limited conservatorship**  
  - The judge takes away only certain rights, like handling large sums of money or signing contracts.  
  - The person keeps all other rights, like where to live or who to see, if they can handle those decisions.

- **Full conservatorship**  
  - The judge takes control over almost every area of life.  
  - This is usually only for people who cannot make *any* important decisions.

Limited conservatorship is more common and should be the first choice when possible, because it is less restrictive.

# Types of conservatorships

The court can split power into two main parts:

1. **Conservator of the person**  
   - Helps with personal decisions:  
     - Where the person lives.  
     - Saying yes or no to medical care.  
     - Work, day programs, and activities.  
   - May have to send reports to the court about how the person is doing.

2. **Conservator of the estate (money and property)**  
   - Handles money, benefits, and property.  
   - Pays bills and protects assets.  
   - Must keep good records and report to the court.  
   - Usually has to post a bond to protect the person’s money.

Sometimes one person fills both roles; sometimes different people share the duties.

# When money is small

Some people on SSI or Medicaid waiver services can only have a small amount of savings (often around a few thousand dollars).  
If the person has very little money, a full money conservatorship may bring a lot of paperwork and cost without many benefits.

In those cases, you might look at:

- A representative payee for benefits.  
- A small, supervised bank account.  
- Special needs trusts or ABLE accounts when there are more assets to protect.

# Working with the person’s wishes

Even if there is a conservatorship, the person still has rights.

The conservator should:

- Treat the person with respect.  
- Ask the person what they want whenever possible.  
- Learn about the person’s values, habits, and preferences.  
- Make choices that match what the person would choose, if they could decide safely.

This is called “substituted judgment”: acting the way the person would likely act, not just doing what is easiest for the conservator.

When the person’s wishes are unknown, the conservator should think about what a reasonable person would do in that situation and what is in the person’s best interest.

# Co‑conservators and backups

Sometimes the court picks more than one conservator (for example, both parents).  
The court order should say if each conservator can act alone or if both must agree.

The court can also name:

- A **standby** or **successor** conservator who steps in if the first conservator dies or cannot serve.  
- A temporary conservator in a true emergency, for a short time, to handle a serious medical or money crisis.

These setups are meant to keep the person protected if something happens to the first conservator.

# Key ideas to remember

- Conservatorship is serious. It takes away rights.  
- It should only be used when other supports are not enough.  
- The court should remove the **minimum** rights needed to keep the person safe.  
- The person should stay in control of as much of their life as possible.  
- Families should ask about all options before agreeing to a conservatorship.
