# What is a conservatorship in Tennessee?

A conservatorship is when a judge picks an adult to make some decisions for another adult.

The person who needs help is called the person with a disability.  
The person the judge picks to help is called the conservator.

The judge can take away some rights from the person with a disability and give those rights to the conservator.  
The judge should only take the rights that are truly needed, not everything.

A conservatorship might be needed when a person:

- Has strong memory problems like dementia or Alzheimer’s.
- Has a bad brain injury.
- Has a serious learning or thinking problem.
- Has mental illness or a medical problem that makes it hard to think clearly.

The court should look for the least restrictive plan.  
That means the judge should try to leave the person with as many rights as possible.

# What do you need to file in Shelby County?

To start, you must file a written request called a petition in Shelby County Probate Court.

The petition should include:

- Name, birthday, and address in Memphis or Shelby County for the person who needs help.
- Your name, how you are related, and your contact information.
- Simple words about why the person cannot handle personal or money decisions.

# Medical proof the court usually wants

The judge will normally want a doctor or mental health worker to write a report.

This report should:

- Say what the person’s health or mental problem is.
- Say how the problem makes it hard for the person to make decisions.
- Say if the person’s condition might get better or is likely to stay the same.

The report should be recent, not old.

If the person refuses to see a doctor, the judge can order an exam.

### The guardian ad litem and the lawyer for the person

When you file the papers, the court usually picks two lawyers:

1. A **Guardian ad Litem (GAL)**  
   - The judge signs an **Order Appointing Guardian ad Litem** that explains what the GAL must do.  
   - The GAL may:
     - Talk to the person with a disability and to the proposed conservator.  
     - Talk to family members and other people who know the situation.  
     - Read medical and money records.  
   - The GAL then writes a report and recommendation for the judge.

2. An **attorney for the person with a disability**  
   - This lawyer speaks for the person with a disability.  
   - They can agree or disagree with the conservatorship and present evidence to the court.

# What happens at the court hearing?

After the papers and reports are ready, the court sets a hearing date.

At the hearing:

- You tell the judge why you think the person needs a conservator.
- You may share medical papers and other proof.
- The guardian ad litem gives the judge their report.
- The person with a disability, or their lawyer, can speak and disagree.

The judge then decides:

- Does this person really need a conservator?
- Is there a less restrictive way to help them?
- Who should be the conservator?
- What powers should the conservator have (money, health, or both)?

If the judge approves, the court signs an Order of Conservatorship.

The new conservator usually must:

- Promise to follow the court’s rules.
- List the person’s money and property for the court.
- Sometimes pay for a bond if handling money, to protect the person’s property.
- Send regular reports to the court.

### After the judge approves

If the judge approves a conservatorship:

- The court signs an Order of Conservatorship.  
- The new conservator must sign an **Oath of Conservator**, promising the court they will follow the rules and act in the person’s best interest.  
- If the conservator will handle money or property, the court may also require a bond before they can start using those powers.

# What does a conservator do for the person?

A conservator of the person helps with health and daily life.

- Helping arrange care at home or in a facility if needed.
- Helping with doctor visits and medicine.

# What does a conservator do with money and property?

   - Make a list of all the person’s money and property.  
   - Share this list with the court.

   - Make a simple plan for how the money will be used.  
   - Get the court’s okay for big plans and big purchases.

3. **Yearly reports**  
   - Once a year, write down all the money that came in and all the money that was spent.  
   - Give bank statements and other proof to the court.

4. **Closing the case**  
   - If the person dies, the conservator must help with basic burial plans and then give a final money report to the court.  
   - After that, the court can close the conservatorship.

If a conservator does not follow the rules, the court can remove them and may make them pay money back.

Other options may include:

- Power of attorney for money.
- Power of attorney for health.
